Sociophonetic variation in Afrikaans vowel production [DH/DS]
In this project, students will analyze a dataset consisting of acoustic features of vowels (first
and second formant) that have been produced by white and colored speakers of Afrikaans, a
Germanic language that is spoken (mainly) in South Africa. The data have been recorded
using two different methods (word lists vs. speech in context) by Daan Wissing (North West
University, Potchefstroom, South Africa). Acoustic features have been already extracted for
all configurations. The goal of the project is to compare the different configurations to assess
(a) whether the examined sociolinguistic variants of Afrikaans differ from each other and (b)
to what extent results based on different methodologies match.

Data:
 A: coloured Afrikaans, reading
 B: white Afrikaans, reading
 C: coloured Afrikaans, word list
 D: white Afrikaans, word list
Task:
1. Main questions:
a. Sociolinguistic differences: A vs. B &amp; C vs. D
b. Methodological differences: A vs. C &amp; C vs. D
2. Visualize each of the four vowel spaces A-D (F1 &amp; F2); do this more beautifully than
in the paper above!
3. Think of a neat way of comparing two vowel spaces (something along the lines of
Wissing et al. 2023, or, even better, something different)
a. How can one measure the distance (effect size) between two vowel spaces?
b. How can one quantify to what extent vowel realizations are more dispersed
on one of the two vowel spaces?
c. Howe can one measure which vowel contributes most to the distance
between two vowel spaces, i.e., which vowel is most impactful?
