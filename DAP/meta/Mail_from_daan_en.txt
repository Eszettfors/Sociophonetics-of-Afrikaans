Best Andreas, It was meaningful to hold back the sets and go through them again for errors - which I did find.

Hello Andreas, here is the "correct" data, as you can see, there are four sets: two from Coloured speakers and two from White speakers. The primary comparisons related to our research question are those between A and B (both Coloured speakers), and secondarily C and D (both White speakers). The datasets for A and B are of equal size and were done by the same readers. C and D are not from the same speakers; D is also large, but C is much smaller, making comparisons likely difficult. But you will see for yourself when you open it.

You will probably decide for yourself to compare different comparisons with specific objectives (such as comparing B with D, which might reveal something, especially if the difference here is smaller than in the case of B compared to A). Of course, I am very curious, but see where you can fit this work into your program.

I have tried to maintain uniformity regarding the structure - as I discussed with you. Furthermore, all the vowels are also informally labeled, not with the official IPA phonetic symbol system. This is because some of the symbols are not acceptable in Statistica - I first worked there and then transferred it to Excel, which was problematic.

Some remarks:

I did not include F1 and F2 glide for now – this is like what we did with the Vowel Spaces article, remember?
The vowels are not in IPA convention; that can happen later. For now, I did it this way because Statistica and Excel didn't work well together in that regard.
Good luck with this; I am very curious about what Zaubermann will do with it! Greetings, until next time. D.

Hello Andreas, here is the "correct" data, as you can see, there are four sets: two from Coloured speakers, and two from Whites. The primary comparisons regarding our research question are A with B (Coloured speakers), and secondarily C with D (White speakers). A and B are from the same group of Coloured speakers – thus also equally sized, but C and D are two different sets; D is also large, but C is much smaller.

I have tried to maintain as much uniformity in terms of structure as possible - as I discussed with you. Furthermore, all the vowels are also informally labeled, not with the official IPA phonetic symbol system.

Hello Andreas, I hope and trust that you returned safely to W and that you have already found your feet again. It was particularly nice to see you again: Ur-awesome!

As promised, I have completed the comprehensive dataset. Before I send it to you, I just want to make sure of the structure. Please check the accompanying Excel file. You will see:

The main question regarding the comparison of a) Word Lists vs b) Running Text (The North Wind and the Sun) is covered if one has two datasets, as mentioned in the first two rows. There are 300 Coloured speakers who have read both a) and b). This is what I thought would address our question. The rest are extra, and might also be interesting to examine: here I also have b)-data from 80 speakers of another group, which we might also use.

I am adding WHITE, only for the sake of interest. At the moment, I am only sure that I have Word Lists from a smaller group of speakers, but possibly I will also discover Running Text from the same group or perhaps from another group. But it does not seem very useful. Perhaps a secondary comparison of WHITE's word list with that of COLOURED might be useful after all. What do you think?

My main question at the moment is whether you will be able to work with one large dataset with this structure - that's how I understood you. If you give the green light, I will send everything to you.

Until later, then again. Kind regards there, Daan.

Let me know if you need any further clarification!
