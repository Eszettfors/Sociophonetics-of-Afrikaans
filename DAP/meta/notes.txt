Wann und unter welchen Umst채nden haben die Aufnahmen stattgefunden?

Are the speakers from the same area?

Do we know anything about the age and gender of B?

Is the C dataset the same as in previous paper? Distribution looks the same.

Were the formants extracted in the same way as in previous paper?

Are the F1 and F2 values for diphthongs calculated as averages?

How to handle missing age/gender values?

Do we treat diphthongs as monophthongs like in the paper?

Different number of vowel recording per speaker, how to go about?

How do we handle outliers?

Very unbalanced data set in the number of data points for different vowels, and some only covering a few vowels
Since D only contain female speakers -> reduce the analysis to only account for women?

Dataset A is problematic due to frontvowel being from other speakers than the back vowels.
Daan claims that the readers are the same for the coloured speakers, but that can't be right, since the data
is so different. 

Mean of dataset be is much lower than in the other datasets, what could be the reason?

What is normal variations in f1 and f2 for the same vowel for one speaker? See dataframe B for example

Thoughts

The words in the reading are not the same as the wordlists.

To be able to say something about the difference in methodology, you would need to have the same person do both reading and
wordlist to compare. 

Original paper concluded that age and gender only have a small effect -> is not important.


### most important points:
Dataset A is of such low quality(different speakers, not all vowels covered, not all readings(as B) disparity in vowel recordings) that an Analysis can't really say anything:
Possible solution: Only look at back vowels: 87 speakers with full coverage and compare with backvowels in B and C. 

remove speakers which only have a few vowels recorded -> make the datasets more equal.
