This code base was developed to hold the code written for the Data Analysis Project course at the University of Vienna H2024 under the supervision of Andreas Baumann. The data was supplied by Daan Wissing at North-West University.

In the project, we compare the vowelspace between two sociophonetic groups quantitatively and deploy a new measure using cliff's Delta. For an overview, please see the poster.
